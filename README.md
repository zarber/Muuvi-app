This project was made during Spring 2023 by Aaron Juhola, Enni Niininen and Arbër Zeqiri.

Aaron Juhola was in charge of creating exerciseplan and making sure you can view it through patients and nurses user interface even though sliglty different version for both.

Enni Niininen was in charge of fetching readiness data from Kubios Cloud and using that data for different charts. Enni was responsible for building the website (including a lot of CSS-styling, handlebars, registeration, authentication for different user roles). Patientlist was made in cooperation with Enni and Aaron.

Arbër Zeqiri was in charge of the diary and activities features. In activites we wanted to implement Polar Accesslink, but we didn't have any time life. There's is a folder for Polar API where you can see what we've worked on. At the moment I can only fetch the user data, nothing else.
